STUDENT. OK, let's just start with the simply typed lambda calculus to see how this
works. Let's define just the basics: application, lambda abstraction, and the arrow type.

ADVISOR. Right. We will first need to define the two meta-types for these two sorts:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
term : type.
typ : type.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. Oh, so `type` is the reserved keyword for the meta-level kind of types, and we'll
use `typ` for our object-level types?

ADVISOR. Exactly. And let's do the easy constructors first:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
app : term -> term -> term.
arrow : typ -> typ -> typ.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. So we add constructors to a type at any point; we do not list them out when we
define it like in Haskell. But how about lambdas? I have heard that 位Prolog supports
higher-order abstract syntax \citep{hoas-standard-reference}, which should make those really easy to add, too, right?

ADVISOR. Yes, functions at the meta level are parametric, so they correspond exactly to
single-variable binding -- they cannot perform any computation such as pattern matching
on their argument and thus we do not have to worry about exotic terms. So this works fine for
Church-style lambdas:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
lam : typ -> (term -> term) -> term.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. I see. And how about the typing judgment, $\Gamma \vdash e : \tau$ ?

ADVISOR. Let's add a *predicate* for that: a new constructor for the type of `prop`ositions. It will
relate a `term` $e$ to its `typ`, $\tau$. Only, no $\Gamma$, there is an implicit context of
assumptions that will serve the same purpose.

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
typeof : term -> typ -> prop.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. I see. We now need to give the rules that make up the predicate, right? Let me see if I can get the typing rule for application. I know that in Prolog we write the
conclusion of a rule first, and the premises follow the `:-` sign. Does something like this work?

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
typeof (app E1 E2) T' :- typeof E1 (arrow T T'), typeof E2 T.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

ADVISOR. Yes! That's exactly right. Makam uses capital letters for unification variables.

STUDENT. I will need help with the lambda typing rule, though. What's the equivalent of
extending the context as in $\Gamma, \; x : \tau$ ?

ADVISOR. Simple: we introduce a fresh constructor for terms and a new typing rule for it:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
typeof (lam T1 E) (arrow T1 T2) :-
  (x:term -> typeof x T1 -> typeof (E x) T2).
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. Hmm, so '`x:term ->`' introduces the fresh constructor standing for the new
variable, and '`typeof x T1 ->`' introduces the new assumption? Oh, and we need to get to
the body of the lambda function in order to type-check it, so that's why you do `E x`.

ADVISOR. Yes. Note that the introductions are locally scoped, so they are only in effect
for the recursive call '`typeof (E x) T2`'.

STUDENT. Makes sense. So do we have a type checker already?

ADVISOR. We do! We can issue *queries* of the `typeof` predicate to type check terms. Observe:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
typeof (lam _ (fun x => x)) T ?
>> Yes:
>> T := arrow T1 T1.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. Cool! So `fun` for metalevel functions, underscores for unification variables we don't care
about, and `?` for queries. But wait, last time I implemented unification in my toy STLC
implementation it was easy to make it go into an infinite loop with $\lambda x. x x$. How does that
work here?

ADVISOR. Well, you were missing the occurs-check. 位Prolog unification includes it:

```makam
typeof (lam _ (fun x => app x x)) T' ?
>> Impossible.
```

STUDENT. Right. So let's see, what else can we do? How about adding tuples to our language?
Can we use something like a polymorphic list?

ADVISOR. Sure, 位Prolog has polymorphic types and higher-order predicates. Here's how lists
are defined in the standard library:

```
list : type -> type.
nil : list A.
cons : A -> list A -> list A.

map : (A -> B -> prop) -> list A -> list B -> prop.
map P nil nil.
map P (cons X XS) (cons Y YS) :- P X Y, map P XS YS.
```

STUDENT. Nice! I guess that's why you wanted to go with 位Prolog for doing this instead of
LF, since you cannot use polymorphism there?

ADVISOR. Indeed. We will see, once we figure out what our language should be, one thing we
could do is monomorphize our definitions to LF, and then we could even use Beluga
\citep{beluga-main-reference} to do all of our metatheoretic proofs. Or maybe we could
use Abella \citep{abella-main-reference} directly.

STUDENT. Sounds good. So, for tuples, this should work:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
tuple : list term -> term.
product : list typ -> typ.
typeof (tuple ES) (product TS) :- map typeof ES TS.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

ADVISOR. Yes, and there is syntactic sugar for `cons` and `nil` too:

```makam
typeof (lam _ (fun x => lam _ (fun y => tuple [x, y]))) T ?
>> Yes:
>> T := arrow T1 (arrow T2 (product [T1, T2])).
```

STUDENT. So how about evaluation? Can we write the big-step semantics too?

ADVISOR. Why not? Let's add a predicate and do the two easy rules:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
eval : term -> term -> prop.
eval (lam T F) (lam T F).
eval (tuple ES) (tuple VS) :- map eval ES VS.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

STUDENT. OK, let me try my hand at the beta-redex case. I'll just do call-by-value. I know
that when using HOAS, function application is exactly capture-avoiding substitution, so
this should be fine:

\importantCodeblock{}
```makam
eval (app E E') V'' :- eval E (lam _ F), eval E' V', eval (F V') V''.
```
\importantCodeblockEnd{}

ADVISOR. Exactly! See, I told you this would be easy!
