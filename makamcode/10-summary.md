# In which our heroes summarize what they've done and our story concludes before the credits start rolling

STUDENT. I feel like we've done a lot here. And some of the things we did I don't think
I've seen in the literature before, but then again, it's not clear to me what's
Makam-specific and what isn't. In any case, I think a lot of people would find that
quickly prototyping their PL research ideas using this style of higher-order logic
programming is very useful.

ADVISOR. I agree, though it would be hard for somebody to publish a paper on this. Some of
it is novel, some of it is folklore, some of it, we just did in a pleasant way; and we
did also use a couple of not-so-pleasant hacks. But let's make a list of what's what.

\vspace{-0.5em}
- We defined HOAS encodings of complicated binding forms, including mutually recursive definitions
  and patterns, while only having explicit support in our metalanguage for single-variable
  binding. These encodings seem to have been part of PL folklore, but we believe that a type like
  `bindmany` has never been shown as a reusable datatype that \lamprolog makes possible.  We have
  made use of GADTs to encode some of these binding structures precisely, which we show are
  supported in \lamprolog through ad-hoc polymorphism.  This we believe is a novel usage for this
  \lamprolog feature. Our binding constructions should be replicable in other Î»Prolog implementations
  like Teyjus \citep{teyjus-main-reference,teyjus-2-implementation} and in ELPI \citep{elpi-main-reference}.

- We defined a generic predicate to perform structural recursion using a very concise
  definition. It allows us to define structurally recursive predicates that only explicitly
  list out the important cases, in what we believe is a novel encoding for the \lamprolog
  setting. Any new definitions, such as constructors or datatypes we introduce later, do
  not need any special provision to be covered by the same predicates. They depend on a
  number of reflective predicates, most of which are available in other Prolog and \lamprolog dialects.
  These predicates are used to reflect on the structure of Makam terms and to
  get the list of local assumptions; for the most part, their use is limited to predicates
  that would be part of the standard library, not in user code.

- The above encodings are reusable and have been made part of the Makam standard library. As
  a result, we were able to develop the type checker for quite an advanced type system, in
  very few lines of code specific to it, using rules that we believe do not, presentation-wise, stray
  far from their pen-and-paper versions. Our development
  includes mutually recursive definitions, polymorphism, datatypes,
  pattern matching, a conversion rule, Hindley-Milner type generalization, and staging
  constructs that allow the computation of contextually typed open terms of the simply typed
  lambda calculus. We are not aware of another metalinguistic framework that allows this
  level of expressivity and has been used to encode such type-system features with the same
  level of concision.

- We have also shown that higher-order logic programming allows not just meta-level
  functions to be reused for encoding object-level binding; there are also cases where
  meta-level unification can also be reused to encode certain object-level features:
  for example, doing type generalization as in Algorithm W.

STUDENT. Well, that was very interesting; thank you for working with me on this!

ADVISOR. I enjoyed this, too. Say, if you want to relax, there's a new staging of the classic play by \citet{fischer2010play} downtown -- I saw it yesterday, and it is really good!

STUDENT. That's a great idea! You know, I wish there were more plays like it.... Well, good night, and see you on Monday!
