\section{Where our heroes get the easy stuff out of the
way}\label{where-our-heroes-get-the-easy-stuff-out-of-the-way}

\heroSTUDENT{} OK, let's just start with the simply typed lambda calculus to
see how this works. Let's define just the basics: application, lambda
abstraction, and the arrow type.

\heroADVISOR{} Right. We will first need to define the two meta-types for
these two sorts:

\begin{verbatim}
term : type.
typ : type.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} Oh, so \texttt{type} is the reserved keyword for the meta-level
kind of types, and we'll use \texttt{typ} for our object-level types?

\heroADVISOR{} Exactly. And let's do the easy constructors first:

\begin{verbatim}
app : term \ensuremath{\to} term \ensuremath{\to} term.
arrow : typ \ensuremath{\to} typ \ensuremath{\to} typ.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} So we add constructors to a type at any point; we do not list
them out when we define it like in Haskell. But how about lambdas? I
have heard that \foreignlanguage{greek}{位}Prolog supports higher-order abstract syntax, which
should make those really easy to add, too, right?

\heroADVISOR{} Yes, functions at the meta-level are parametric, so they
correspond exactly to single variable binding -- they cannot perform any
computation, and thus we do not have to worry about exotic terms. So
this works fine for Church-style lambdas:

\begin{verbatim}
lam : typ \ensuremath{\to} (term \ensuremath{\to} term) \ensuremath{\to} term.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} I see. And how about the typing judgment,
\(\Gamma \vdash e : \tau\) ?

\heroADVISOR{} Let's add a predicate for that. Only, no \(\Gamma\), there is
an implicit context of assumptions that will serve the same purpose.

\begin{verbatim}
typeof : term \ensuremath{\to} typ \ensuremath{\to} prop.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} Let me see if I can get the typing rule for application. I know
that in Prolog we write the conclusion of a rule first, and the premises
follow the \texttt{:-} sign. Does something like this work?

\begin{verbatim}
typeof (app E1 E2) T' :- typeof E1 (arrow T T'), typeof E2 T.
\end{verbatim}

\heroADVISOR{} Yes! That's exactly right. Makam uses capital letters for
unification variables.

\heroSTUDENT{} I will need help with the lambda typing rule, though. What's
the equivalent of extending the context as in \(\Gamma, \; x : \tau\) ?

\heroADVISOR{} Simple; we introduce a fresh constructor for terms and a new
typing rule for it:

\begin{verbatim}
typeof (lam T1 E) (arrow T1 T2) :- (x:term \ensuremath{\to} typeof x T1 \ensuremath{\to} typeof (E x) T2).
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} Hmm, so \texttt{x:term\ \ensuremath{\to}} introduces the fresh
constructor standing for the new variable, and
\texttt{typeof\ x\ T1\ \ensuremath{\to}} introduces the new assumption?
Oh, and we need to get to the body of the lambda function in order to
type-check it, so that's why you do \texttt{E\ x}.

\heroADVISOR{} Yes. Note that the introductions are locally scoped, so they
are only in effect for the recursive call.

\heroSTUDENT{} Makes sense. So do we have a type checker already? Can we run
queries?

\heroADVISOR{} We do! Observe:

\begin{verbatim}
typeof (lam _ (fun x \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} x)) T ?
>> Yes:
>> T := arrow T1 T1.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} Cool! So underscores for unification variables we don't care
about and \texttt{?} for queries. But wait, last time I implemented
unification in my toy STLC implementation it was easy to make it go into
an infinite loop with \(\lambda x. x x\). How does that work here?

\heroADVISOR{} Well, you were missing the occurs-check. \foreignlanguage{greek}{位}Prolog unification
includes it:

\begin{verbatim}
typeof (lam _ (fun x \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} app x x)) T' ?
>> Impossible.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} Right. So let's see, what else can we do? How about adding
tuples to our language? Can we use something like a polymorphic list?

\heroADVISOR{} Sure, \foreignlanguage{greek}{位}Prolog has polymorphic types and higher-order
predicates. Here's how lists are defined in the standard library:

\begin{verbatim}
list : type \ensuremath{\to} type.
nil : list A. cons : A \ensuremath{\to} list A \ensuremath{\to} list A.

map : (A \ensuremath{\to} B \ensuremath{\to} prop) \ensuremath{\to} list A \ensuremath{\to} list B \ensuremath{\to} prop.
map P nil nil.
map P (cons X XS) (cons Y YS) :- P X Y, map P XS YS.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} Nice! I guess that's why you wanted to go with \foreignlanguage{greek}{位}Prolog for
doing this instead of LF, since you cannot use polymorphism there?

\heroADVISOR{} Indeed. We will see, once we figure out what our language
should be, one thing we could do is transcribe our definitions to LF,
and then we could even use Beluga \citep{beluga-main-reference} to do
all of our metatheoretic proofs. Or maybe we could use Abella
\citep{abella-main-reference} directly.

\heroSTUDENT{} Sounds good. So, for tuples, this should work:

\begin{verbatim}
tuple : list term \ensuremath{\to} term. product : list typ \ensuremath{\to} typ.
typeof (tuple ES) (product TS) :- map typeof ES TS.
\end{verbatim}

\heroADVISOR{} Yes, and we can use syntactic sugar for \texttt{cons} and
\texttt{nil} too:

\begin{verbatim}
typeof (lam _ (fun x \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} lam _ (fun y \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} tuple [x, y]))) T ?
>> Yes:
>> T := arrow T1 (arrow T2 (product [T1, T2])).
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} So how about evaluation? Can we write the big-step semantics
too?

\heroADVISOR{} Why not? Let's add a predicate and do the two easy rules:

\begin{verbatim}
eval : term \ensuremath{\to} term \ensuremath{\to} prop.
eval (lam T F) (lam T F).
eval (tuple ES) (tuple VS) :- map eval ES VS.
\end{verbatim}

\heroSTUDENT{} OK, let me try my hand at the beta-redex case. I'll just do
call-by-value. I know that when using HOAS, function application is
exactly capture-avoiding substitution, so this should be fine:

\begin{verbatim}
eval (app E E') V'' :- eval E (lam _ F), eval E' V', eval (F V') V''.
\end{verbatim}

\heroADVISOR{} Exactly! See, I told you this would be easy!
